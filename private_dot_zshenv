#!/usr/bin/env zsh

# Zsh reads these files in the following order:
# 1. .zshenv - Should only contain userâ€™s environment variables.
# 2. .zprofile - Can be used to execute commands just after logging in.
# 3. .zshrc - Should be used for the shell configuration and for executing commands.
# 4. .zlogin - Same purpose than .zprofile, but read just after .zshrc.
# 5. .zlogout - Can be used to execute commands when a shell exits.

# XDG Base Directory Specification
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html

# Setup the XDG base directory environment variables.
# These variables should be set based on system conventions.
# For macOS, it's different, but not totally incompatible.
# For sake of portability with my scripts, these match what
# the software expects.

# Config

# `(on)` means to sort the glob by name.
# `(N)` enables NULL_GLOB, i.e. no error if the glob generates nothing.
